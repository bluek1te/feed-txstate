## npm install 

in the Nodejs-Express-Sequelizejs-PostgreSQL directory to install
all node modules.

## npm start

to launch the backend server.

app contains controller, config, model, and route. route contains api calls, model contains
class definitions, controller handels all api calls, and config specifies the database
makeup. 

## USEFUL: 

install postman and submit requests to the backend server (which is by default
configured to launch on a local host). Also, install pgAdmin 4, a PostgreSQL tool
, to monitor how the code is storing the data.


The "customer" files are meant to be used as a template to create our 
models, controllers, and route files. Model these files after the example
food bank record documents that Stephanie Long shared with the group. 
Customer files should be deleted when backend server implementation is 
complete.


## NOTE: This server is not connected to the front end application.
